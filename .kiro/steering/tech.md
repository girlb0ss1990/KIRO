# Technology Stack

## Development Environment
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with Kiro AI assistant integration
- **Platform**: Windows (win32)
- **Shell**: Command Prompt (cmd)

## AI Assistant Configuration
- **Kiro Agent**: Configured with MCP disabled
- **Steering Rules**: Markdown-based guidance system in `.kiro/steering/`

## Common Commands
Since this is an initial workspace setup, specific build/test commands will depend on the technology stack chosen for the project.

### General Development Commands
```cmd
# List directory contents
dir

# Create new directory
mkdir <directory_name>

# Copy files
copy <source> <destination>
```

## Future Technology Considerations
This workspace is ready to accommodate various technology stacks:
- Node.js/JavaScript projects
- Python applications
- .NET projects
- Go applications
- Rust projects

The steering rules and development workflow will be updated as the specific technology stack is chosen.
